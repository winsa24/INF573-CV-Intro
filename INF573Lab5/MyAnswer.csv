Question 1:,Because it’s a colorful picture and the first dimension represents the RGB channels.
Question 2:,y = 𝐶×(𝑈1 -𝐹1 +1)×(𝑈2 -𝐹2 +1)
Question 3:,(a) Laplacian Kernel (b) Edges (c) Each color will get enhanced
Question 4:,"Because if there are only linear functions,  no matter how many layers your neural network has, the output is a linear combination of the input, each layer is equivalent to matrix multiplication. Adding non-linear function is to increase the nonlinear relationship between the layers of the neural network. To make it more suitable to solve complicated problem."
Question 5:,"Each 15*15 pixes take the max numbers inside them, so the input is downsampled"
Question 6:,"6 layers include 4 convolution layers and 2 pooling layers. Following the order, the size for each filter is 5*5, 5*5, 4*4, 2*2"
Question 7:,"(a) 12 iter/s 
(b) Loss is for counting the errors and Accuracy is the percentage we receive real true result. 
(c) No, they shouldn’t be equal. Because training it’s the procedure of learning so it should change more dramatically, but for validation, ideally it should always keep a good result. For loss, since we want to receive minimal number, Validation should be lower than the Training. For accuracy, it’s the opposite."
Question 8:,My image shows a kaki
